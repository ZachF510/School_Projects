This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Michael Simpson (misimpso@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Zachary Friedrich (zfriedri@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individualâ€™s effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Michael Simpson spent _3_ hours working alone.
Zachary Friedrich spent _3_ hours working alone.
We spent  _2_ hours working together.
Michael Simpson spent _5_ hours driving.
Zachary Friedrich spent _5_ hours driving.
